                    Todo list app is pretty common nowaday, but some of them were not free or with only limited feature on the free version, by creating a completely free todo list app, we can make it more accessible to everyone.

                    One example is the Anydo web app, it provides a todo list with a free and pay verision, while the free version was missing some feature such as able to create recurring tasks.
